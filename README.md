# All-Lives-Matter

All lives are not created equal.

But civilized laws make people equal and have rights to protect themselves.

All of us are unique, so we are all different, that is the root of discrimination & diversity.

we must tolerate and embrace them, for their human nature.

Only law, we are equal.
